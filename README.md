# Meadow AI - Crop Prediction System

## Overview

Meadow AI is a machine learning-powered crop prediction system designed to help small-scale farmers make data-driven decisions. The system consists of a **React Native** application that collects relevant features and predicts the most probable crop labels by communicating with a **proxy server**, which in turn interacts with a deployed machine learning model on **Hugging Face**.

## Architecture

The solution follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture** in the React Native app, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability. It includes:

- **React Native App (Frontend)**: Collects user input, processes feature data, and displays crop predictions.
- **Proxy Server (Backend API)**: Acts as an intermediary between the app and the model, handling requests and responses.
- **ML Model (Hosted on Hugging Face)**: Receives feature data, processes it, and returns predictions.

### Data Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant ReactNativeApp as React Native App
    participant ProxyServer as Proxy Server
    participant MLModel as ML Model (Hugging Face)

    User ->> ReactNativeApp: Inputs environmental conditions
    ReactNativeApp ->> ProxyServer: Sends feature data
    ProxyServer ->> MLModel: Forwards request
    MLModel -->> ProxyServer: Returns predicted crops
    ProxyServer -->> ReactNativeApp: Sends prediction response
    ReactNativeApp -->> User: Displays predicted crops
```

1. The user inputs relevant environmental conditions into the **React Native app**.
2. The app generates feature data and sends a request to the **proxy server**.
3. The **proxy server** forwards the request to the **machine learning model on Hugging Face**.
4. The **ML model** processes the request and returns the most probable crop labels.
5. The **proxy server** relays the response back to the **React Native app**.
6. The app displays the predicted crops to the user.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React Native (MVVM architecture)
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express (Proxy Server)
- **Machine Learning**: XGBoost, KNN, Random Forest (Hosted on Hugging Face)
- **Deployment**: Hugging Face for model hosting
- **Data**: CSV-based dataset from Meedow AIâ€™s repository

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js & npm
- React Native CLI & dependencies
- Python (for ML model development)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
_(You will need access from project owners)_
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MeedowDev/MeedowAI.git
   cd MeedowAI
   ```

2. **Set Up the React Native App**

   ```sh
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npx react-native start
   ```

3. **Set Up the Proxy Server**

   ```sh
   cd backend
   npm install
   node server.js
   ```

4. **Model Deployment on Hugging Face**

   - The trained model is already deployed on Hugging Face.
   - Update the proxy serverâ€™s `.env` file with the model API URL.
